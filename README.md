## Info

Coding the practice exercise given by Nick during his Safari Online Training.


Nick's [Safari Online Training](https://www.safaribooksonline.com/live-training/courses/learning-python-3-by-example/0636920224969/) is running again on Jan 11th. I highly recommended it if you are getting into Python or would like a refresher!
